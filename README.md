- God Loves You!

- 💀 I am SpinalCodeZ and hope you like the work I post. Im new to this coding thing but will keep producing code to improve my skills.

- 👀 I’m interested in coding for God (I want to glorify The Most High with my work, so expect to see some Christian related stuff in my comments, webpages, etc).
 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, HTML, CSS, and going to start in JavaScript. I am new, but passionate and hope to grow into a decent dev.
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on backend development, games, and I enjoy doing some front end stuff solo, but a mentor would be nice until I figure it out more:)
  
- 📫 How to reach me tiktok, discord, instagram, twitter, youtube, and I just got microsoft teams and am more than happy to communicate over teams and email (message me on tiktok or instagram for the details. Email is linked to youtube profile).
